# lion-turtle-role-gifter
> If you ask nicely the lion turtle will gift you with a role.

This is a simple discord role selection bot in the theme of a lion turtle, from the show Avatar: The Last Airbender, gifting users with an element (a customizable discord role).

## Find a Lion Turtle myself (hosting your own)
1. Add your token to the `config.json` file
2. Add role ids in `dc-role-bot.py`
3. Start the bot
4. Type `/spawnTurtle`
5. React to an Element

## Invite an existing Lion Turtle (using an already hosted instance)
If you don't want to find a lion turtle, willing to help your guild, you can use our lion turtle!
Just open [this](todo) link to invite the lion turtle to your guild.  
Keep in mind, that our lion turtle might not always be wanting to help you (we don't guarantee accessability/uptime).
