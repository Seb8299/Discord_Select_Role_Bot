# lion-turtle-role-gifter
> If you ask nicely the lion turtle will gift you with a role.

This is a simple discord role selection bot in the theme of a lion turtle, from the show Avatar: The Last Airbender, gifting users with an element (a customizable discord role).

## Find a Lion Turtle myself (hosting your own)
### Podman (Docker)
1. Make sure you have podman or docker installed
2. Clone or download and unzip the repository
3. Create a file called `config.json` and enter `{ "token": "<my-token>"}` (make sure to replace `<my-token>` with your discord bot token)
4. Run `docker build -t lion-bot .`
5. Run `docker run -d --name lion-bot-container lion-bot`

## Invite an existing Lion Turtle (using an already hosted instance)
If you don't want to find a lion turtle, willing to help your guild, you can use our lion turtle!
Just open [this](todo) link to invite the lion turtle to your guild.  
Keep in mind, that our lion turtle might not always be wanting to help you (we don't guarantee accessability/uptime).
